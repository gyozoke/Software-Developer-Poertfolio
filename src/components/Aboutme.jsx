          After nearly 20 years in customer service, I decided to switch
          careers. I kicked things off by learning about UX design. Along the
          way, I got into coding and decided to explore it further. I started
          with online resources and stumbled upon Northcoders through a social
          media ad. Northcoders challenged me daily, however the journey has
          been genuinely rewarding, and I am happy to see the progress I've
          made! Excited to learn more and enhance my newly acquired skills even
          further.
